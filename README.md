# Maksimo-team
We want to be able to login and check main functionality.
In our opinion, the main functions to check with automation before each release are:
Admin: to add providers and their dishes;
Customer: to be able to choose providers->dishes and add them to order for specific date. 

Unfortunately we couldn't complete the full excercise as we couldn't locate stable locators for changing items.

We managed however to automate login, and that is better than nothing :)
